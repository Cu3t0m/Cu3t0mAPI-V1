# About
---

Cu3t0mApi is an api wrapper for my api that I made for fun in around 20 minutes. As of writing, there are only a few endpoints but I plan to add more. My code is badly and lazily written but hey, it works!

# Memes
---
```py
Cu3t0mAPI.memes(topic, amount)
# Default topic is the subreddit 'memes' and default amount is '1'.
```
Will return Memes from Reddit.

Usage:
```py
import Cu3t0mAPI

memes = Cu3t0mAPI.memes()
print(memes)
```
```

# Ai Response

```py
Cu3t0mAPI.ai_response(question)
# Question is a required argument.
```
Will return an AI response.

Usage:
```py
import Cu3t0mAPI

x=69
print("Simple use of the 'ai_response' function.")
while x == 69:
  q = input("")
  resp = Cu3t0mAPI.ai_response(q)
  response = json.loads(resp)
  print(response["message"])
